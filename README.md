### Hey there 👋

Hi, I’m Ryan! With a solid background in IT and cybersecurity, I'm currently focused on DevSecOps and AWS cloud security. My goal is to ensure application pipelines are rock-solid with top-notch security practices. I work seamlessly with IT Ops, security, software developers, and DevOps teams to embed security from day one to deployment.

I'm passionate about securing application pipelines by shifting security left and using tools like SCA, SAST, and DAST. I stay updated on the latest trends in cloud app security and enjoy finding ways to leverage AI safely. I'm a big advocate for having security champions on every team and fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing to save time and reduce vulnerabilities.
