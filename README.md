### Hey there üëã

Hi, I‚Äôm Ryan! With a solid background in IT and cybersecurity, I've been pushing my expertise in AI Security and DevSecOps with the goal of ensuring best security practices. I work seamlessly with IT Ops, security, software developers, and DevOps teams to embed security from day one to deployment.

I'm passionate about securing application pipelines by shifting security left and have used tools within SCA, SAST, and DAST testing. I stay updated on the latest trends and enjoy finding ways to leverage AI safely. I'm a big advocate for having security champions on every team and fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing to save time and reduce vulnerabilities.
