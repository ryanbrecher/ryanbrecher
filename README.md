### Hi there 👋

I'm Ryan, an accomplished senior cybersecurity professional with a robust background encompassing 7+ years of expertise in networking, voice, system administration, cloud (AWS/Azure), and web development using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and popular libraries. I've primarily worked with and for ISPs, MSPs and MSSPs. I also have experience in DevOps tools with a particular interest in growing my DevSecOps knowledge so I can create and maintain DevSecOps pipelines using SCA, SAST, DAST, and Security as Code.
